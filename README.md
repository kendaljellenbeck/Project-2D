# Project-2D
This is the final draft of project 2. You will need two files in order to adequately run the code.

The Jupyter Notebook
The Dataset that was used (uploaded here)
The dataset I used was only available in R language, so I had to download R studio and convert each of the datasets to python. Here is the github page where all the data is located: https://github.com/nhanhocu/metamicrobiome_breastfeeding . Once I was able to convert each of the datasets that I needed into csv files I was able to download them into my jupyter notebook and use the data for further analysis. 

Thanks for a great quarter!
